This project spotlights the standout dining scene and iconic landmarks of San Sebastián, Spain, widely regarded as the second food capital of the world. It includes my favorite restaurants, pintxo bars, cafés, landmarks, and things to do in the city through an interactive, personally-curated map.

The map provides a fast, visual way to explore where I ate, what stood out, and how each spot fits into the city’s layout. Anyone viewing it can see the exact locations, plan their own food route, or compare neighborhoods at a glance.
